Generate an API using Nest.js with the following endpoint:
GET /events -> list all events
POST /events -> create an event
An event has the following properties:
* name (32 chars max)
* description
* start date
* end date
* timezone

---

Add validation on the dates

---

Generate some unit tests for EventsController

---

Do not mock eventservice

---

Now generate a react app using vite that list the events and has a page to create some events using the api

---

Use typescript

---
Write a simple readme to explain how to start the project
